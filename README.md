# Football Monopoly
Welcome to Football Monopoly! This is a Java-based implementation of the classic Monopoly game, adjusted to revolve around the world of football. In this version, players become billionaires competing in the football industry, aiming to emerge as the last person standing without going bankrupt.

## How to Play
### Setup
* Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Compile: Compile the Java files using any Java compiler.
* Run: Run the Main class to start the game.
* Play: Use CLI (Command-line interface) to play the game.

## Rules
* Objective: The objective of Football Monopoly is similar to the original Monopoly â€“ become the last player standing without going bankrupt.
* Gameplay: Players roll two six-sided dice and move their tokens around the board according to the number rolled.
* Property: Instead of traditional Monopoly properties, players can buy football clubs, media, or shares in football organizations like FIFA and UEFA.
* Rent: When opponents land on a property owned by another player, they must pay rent.
* Player Acquisition: Owning all clubs in a league allows players to purchase players for those clubs, starting with a goalkeeper and ending with a forward. However, Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules limit the number of players that can be bought in one round.
* Financial Management: Players can sell players during difficult times and mortgage properties to the bank for half the price.
* Prison: Landing on prison skips a player's turn. They can pay a fine or attempt to roll doubles to escape.
* Victory: The last player remaining without going bankrupt wins the game.

## Gameplay Features
* Object-Oriented Design: Football Monopoly is implemented using object-oriented programming principles, providing a modular and extensible codebase.
* Player Interaction: Players can enter their names and specify the number of players before starting the game.
* Turn-Based: The game proceeds through rounds until a winner is determined.
